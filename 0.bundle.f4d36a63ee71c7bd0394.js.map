For operations like addition and\n// multiplication, we split each number into 16 bit pieces, which can easily be\n// multiplied within Javascript's floating-point representation without overflow\n// or change in sign.\n//\n// In the algorithms below, we frequently reduce the negative case to the\n// positive case by negating the input(s) and then post-processing the result.\n// Note that we must ALWAYS check specially whether those values are MIN_VALUE\n// (-2^63) because -MIN_VALUE == MIN_VALUE (since 2^63 cannot be represented as\n// a positive number, it overflows back into a negative).  Not handling this\n// case would often result in infinite recursion.\n//\n// Common constant values ZERO, ONE, NEG_ONE, etc. are defined below the from*\n// methods on which they depend.\n\n/**\n * An indicator used to reliably determine if an object is a Long or not.\n * @type {boolean}\n * @const\n * @private\n */\n\n\nLong.prototype.__isLong__;\nObject.defineProperty(Long.prototype, \"__isLong__\", {\n  value: true\n});\n/**\n * @function\n * @param {*} obj Object\n * @returns {boolean}\n * @inner\n */\n\nexport function isLong(obj) {\n  return (obj && obj[\"__isLong__\"]) === true;\n}\n/**\n * Tests if the specified object is a Long.\n * @function\n * @param {*} obj Object\n * @returns {boolean}\n */\n// Long.isLong = isLong;\n\n/**\n * A cache of the Long representations of small integer values.\n * @type {!Object}\n * @inner\n */\n\nvar INT_CACHE = {};\n/**\n * A cache of the Long representations of small unsigned integer values.\n * @type {!Object}\n * @inner\n */\n\nvar UINT_CACHE = {};\n/**\n * @param {number} value\n * @param {boolean=} unsigned\n * @returns {!Long}\n * @inner\n */\n\nexport function fromInt(value, unsigned) {\n  var obj, cachedObj, cache;\n\n  if (unsigned) {\n    value >>>= 0;\n\n    if (cache = 0 <= value && value < 256) {\n      cachedObj = UINT_CACHE[value];\n      if (cachedObj) return cachedObj;\n    }\n\n    obj = fromBits(value, (value | 0) < 0 ? -1 : 0, true);\n    if (cache) UINT_CACHE[value] = obj;\n    return obj;\n  } else {\n    value |= 0;\n\n    if (cache = -128 <= value && value < 128) {\n      cachedObj = INT_CACHE[value];\n      if (cachedObj) return cachedObj;\n    }\n\n    obj = fromBits(value, value < 0 ? -1 : 0, false);\n    if (cache) INT_CACHE[value] = obj;\n    return obj;\n  }\n}\n/**\n * Returns a Long representing the given 32 bit integer value.\n * @function\n * @param {number} value The 32 bit integer in question\n * @param {boolean=} unsigned Whether unsigned or not, defaults to signed\n * @returns {!Long} The corresponding Long value\n */\n// Long.fromInt = fromInt;\n\n/**\n * @param {number} value\n * @param {boolean=} unsigned\n * @returns {!Long}\n * @inner\n */\n\nexport function fromNumber(value, unsigned) {\n  if (isNaN(value)) return unsigned ?
