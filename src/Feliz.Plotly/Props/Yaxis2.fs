    /// Specifies the ordering logic for the case of categorical variables. By default, plotly uses *trace*, which specifies the order that is present in the data supplied. Set `categoryorder` to *category ascending* or *category descending* if order should be determined by the alphanumerical order of the category names. Set `categoryorder` to *array* to derive the ordering from the attribute `categoryarray`. If a category is not found in the `categoryarray` array, the sorting behavior for that attribute will be identical to the *trace* mode. The unspecified categories will follow the categories in `categoryarray`. Set `categoryorder` to *total ascending* or *total descending* if order should be determined by the numerical order of the values. Similarly, the order can be determined by the min, max, sum, mean or median of all the values.
